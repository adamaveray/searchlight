Searchlight
===========

A lightweight Safari extension to focus on any site's search input. [Download here](https://github.com/adamaveray/searchlight/releases/download/v1/Searchlight.safariextz)

Just press `ctrl`+`f` on any page, and the plugin will try to locate it's primary search input and focus on it.

[WTFPL](LICENCE.txt), it's like 30 lines.
